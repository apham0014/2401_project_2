# Project 2
This program simulates a resource management system using multithreading.
A manager thread oversees the simulation, while system threads process resource consumption and production.
The program dynamically manages arrays of resources and systems, ensuring proper memory allocation and cleanup.

## Instructions for Building and Running 
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the appropriate folder containing the program's files.
2. Enter 'make' OR 'gcc -o p2 main.c event.c manager.c resource.c system.c'
3. Then enter './p2'
4. The program will then run according to the pre-defined main flow.
